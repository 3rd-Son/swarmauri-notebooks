    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Swarmauri SDK is built with modularity and reusability in mind. To streamline development, it offers pre-defined functions and tools organized into the following key modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `swarmauri.utils`: Contains utility functions for common operations.\n",
    "- `swarmauri.tools`: Provides pre-built tools such as addition.\n",
    "- `swarmauri.llms`: Includes various pre-integrated language models."

    "## Core Interfaces:\n",
    "These are essential for defining how different system components communicate with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Message Passing**: How data is passed between components.\n",
    "- **Data Sharing**: Protocols for sharing information across system boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Base Classes**: The foundation for creating Swarmauri components.\n",
    "2. **Mixins**: Reusable code that can be integrated into different classes to add shared behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Polymorphism**: Allows components to switch behaviors based on context.\n",
    "- **Discriminated Unions**: Safely handle multiple types of objects in a single framework.\n",
    "- **Serialization**: Transmit data across environments using efficient encoding formats.\n",
    "- **Intensional Programming**: Rule-based logic for flexible, logic-driven systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases:\n",
    "Swarmauri is designed for:\n",
    "- **Modular Systems**: Build scalable, flexible systems by plugging and unplugging components.\n",
    "- **Distributed Architectures**: Develop systems with multiple nodes that communicate seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Community and Contribution:\n",
    "As an open-source project, Swarmauri encourages contributions. Developers can submit new features, bug fixes, and extensions to the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed documentation, visit the [Swarmauri GitHub Repository](https://github.com/swarmauri/swarmauri-sdk)."

    "1. **swarmauri_core**: Defines the core ABC classes, essential for maintaining structure and consistency.  \n",
    "2. **swarmauri**: The main SDK, built on `swarmauri_core`, and used for building AI applications.  \n",
    "3. **swarmauri_community**: Includes additional features like vector databases and integrations.  \n",
    "4. **swarmauri_experimental**: A space for testing new, unstable features. Once stable, they are moved to `swarmauri` or `swarmauri_community`.  "

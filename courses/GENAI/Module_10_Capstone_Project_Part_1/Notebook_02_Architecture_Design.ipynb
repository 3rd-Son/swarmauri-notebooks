    "\n",
    "## 1. **System Architecture**\n",
    "The architecture of the multimodal AI chatbot consists of several key components that work together to provide a seamless user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Core Components**\n",
    "1. **Input Handler**:\n",
    "   - Responsible for processing different input modalities (text, image, audio)\n",
    "   - Performs data validation, preprocessing, and formatting\n",
    "   - Routes the input to the appropriate processing modules\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Multimodal Processor**:\n",
    "   - Manages the integration of various AI models for processing different modalities\n",
    "   - Selects the appropriate model based on the input type\n",
    "   - Coordinates the flow of data between models\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Response Generator**:\n",
    "   - Combines the output from different processing models\n",
    "   - Ensures coherence and consistency across the multimodal response\n",
    "   - Formats the final response for presentation to the user\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Cache Manager**:\n",
    "   - Stores and retrieves previously generated responses\n",
    "   - Implements caching strategies to improve response times\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Flow Design**\n",
    "1. **Input Processing Pipeline**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   Raw Input → Input Handler → Multimodal Processor → Response Generator → Output\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Caching Strategy**:\n",
    "   - Implement a cache key design that considers the input modalities, and user context using **sessioncache conversation available on Swarmauri framework** \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Request/Response Formats**\n",
    "1. **Input Format**:\n",
    "   - Text: Plain text or Markdown\n",
    "   - Image: Base64-encoded image data \n",
    "   - Audio: Base64-encoded audio data \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Format**:\n",
    "   - Multimodal Response: JSON object containing the generated text, image, and audio (if applicable)\n",
    "   - Modality-Specific Response: The specific output data (e.g., text, image, audio) based on the request from user\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - Consistent error response format with error codes and detailed messages\n",
    "   - Provide helpful information to users about the issue and any potential remedies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**This architectural design provides a solid foundation for the multimodal AI chatbot, ensuring modularity and scalability.**\n",
    "**The subsequent notebooks will focus on the implementation details of each component and the overall system integration.**\n"

      "* **Scalability and elasticity:** Cloud computing allows you to easily scale your resources up or down based on demand.

Imagine a shared, digital spreadsheet duplicated across a network of computers.  Every time a new transaction occurs, it's added as a \"block\" to this spreadsheet.  These blocks are linked together chronologically and cryptographically, forming a \"chain.\"  This chain structure is what makes blockchain so secure and tamper-proof.\n",

      "* **Immutable:** Once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This immutability is achieved through cryptographic hashing, where each block is linked to the previous one by a unique \"hash.\"  Changing even a single detail in a block would change its hash and break the chain, making any tampering immediately evident.\n",

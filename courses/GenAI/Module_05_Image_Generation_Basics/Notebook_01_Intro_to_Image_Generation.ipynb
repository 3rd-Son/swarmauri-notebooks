    "## DeepInfra's Approach to Image Generation\n",
    "DeepInfra is a platform that provides scalable access to machine learning and deep learning models through APIs, enabling developers and data scientists to integrate advanced AI capabilities, like image generation or text processing, into their applications without needing to manage the complex infrastructure or model training processes. It often includes models like stable diffusion, GPT models, and other generative or analytical models that are pre-trained and optimized for quick deployment.DeepInfra leverages diffusion models optimized for various use cases and configurations, offering flexibility for generating images based on descriptive prompts."

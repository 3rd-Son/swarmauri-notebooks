With the rapid advancement of Transformer-\\nbased models in natural language processing (NLP) and various visual tasks, Transformer structures are\\nbecoming increasingly prevalent in CV tasks. In recent years, numerous Transformer-based object detectors\\nhave been proposed, achieving performance comparable to mainstream convolutional neural network-based\\n(CNN-based) approaches. To provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the development,\\nadvantages, disadvantages, and future potential of Transformer-based object detectors in Artificial Intelligence\\n(AI), this paper systematically reviews the mainstream methods and analyzes the limitations and challenges\\nencountered in their current applications, while also offering insights into future research directions.

Finally, we summarize the challenges and prospects in this field.\\n1. Introduction\\nObject detection is a fundamental task in computer vision that\\nrequires simultaneous classification and localization of potential objects\\nwithin a single image (Zhao et al., 2019). As such, it plays a cru-\\ncial role in various applications, including autonomous driving (Chen\\net al., 2015, 2017), face recognition (Sung and Poggio, 1998), pedes-\\ntrian detection (Dollar et al., 2012), and medical detection (Kobatake\\nand Yoshinaga, 1996). The performance of object detection directly\\ninfluences object tracking, environment perception, and scene under-\\nstanding (Felzenszwalb et al., 2010). Recently, deep learning-based\\nobject detection methods have gained considerable attention due to\\nthe rapid development of deep learning. However, numerous challenges\\nremain, such as balancing accuracy and efficiency, handling multi-scale\\nobjects, and creating lightweight models.\\nTraditional mainstream object detection methods have predomi-\\nnantly utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs), including Faster\\nR-CNN (Ren et al., 2016), SSD (Liu et al., 2016), and YOLO with\\nits variants (Redmon et al., 2016; Redmon and Farhadi, 2018, 2017;\\nBochkovskiy et al., 2020; Ge et al., 2021).

Li).\\nresearchers have endeavored to adapt Transformer architectures for\\ncomputer vision tasks. As a result, numerous Transformer-based vision\\nmodels have emerged in recent years, achieving performance levels that\\nare comparable or even superior to their CNN counterparts.\\nTransformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) was initially proposed as an\\narchitecture based on the self-attention mechanism for machine trans-\\nlation and sequence modeling tasks (Sutskever et al., 2014). In recent\\nyears, Transformer has experienced significant advancements in NLP\\nand has become a mainstream deep learning model, such as BERT (De-\\nvlin et al., 2018) and its variants (Lan et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019), GPT\\nseries (Radford et al., 2018, 2019; Brown et al., 2020), and others. Due\\nto its scalability, Transformer can be pre-trained on large datasets and\\nsubsequently fine-tuned for downstream tasks.\\nTransformers in object detection have garnered increasing attention,\\nparticularly over the last three years. Several high-performance models\\nhave been proposed, such as DETR (Carion et al., 2020), Deformable\\nDETR (Dai et al., 2017), Swin Transformer (Liu et al., 2021b,a),\\nDINO (Zhang et al., 2022a), and more. Currently, Transformer-based\\nmodels have emerged as a new paradigm in object detection, making a\\nsystematic analysis and evaluation of numerous existing Transformer-\\nbased detectors essential for future research.\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2023.107021\\nReceived 22 October 2022; Received in revised form 25 May 2023; Accepted 19 August 2023\\nEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107021\\n2\\nY. Li et al.\\nFig. 1. Chronological overview of most Transformer-based object detection methods.\\nSome reviews (Khan et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021c; Arkin et al.,\\n2021; Han et al., 2022; Arkin et al., 2022) have provided detailed\\nintroductions and analyses of Transformer-based detectors. In contrast\\nto these surveys, our study not only presents a thorough comparison\\nof the strengths and weaknesses of object detectors based on both\\nTransformer and CNN architectures, but also classifies the prevalent\\nTransformer-based detectors into Transformer Backbone and Trans-\\nformer Neck categories. Moreover, we systematically analyze their\\nperformance, potential, and limitations. We investigate the advance-\\nments and constraints of various state-of-the-art Transformer-based\\ndetectors (Table 6) and establish benchmarks for these methods using\\nthe COCO2017 dataset (Tables. 4, 5). We hope this review delivers\\na comprehensive understanding of Transformer-based object detectors\\nfor researchers.\\nWe have categorized existing methods into two groups based on\\nthe role of Transformer in the overall model architecture: Transformer\\nNeck and Transformer Backbone, as illustrated in Fig. 1. We present\\na detailed analysis of representative methods, compare these methods\\nhorizontally on the COCO2017 dataset (Lin et al., 2014), and summa-\\nrize the novelty of each method, such as Transformer Backbone with\\nhierarchical representation structure, spatial prior acceleration based\\non sparse attention, and pure sequence processing for object detection,\\namong others. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:\\n1. We provide a comprehensive summary of state-of-the-art Trans-\\nformer-based object detectors from the past three years, high-\\nlighting recent breakthroughs in Transformer architecture for\\nobject detection. For each representative model, we offer an in-\\ndepth analysis while examining its relationship and connections\\nwith other models, both incrementally and comparatively. More-\\nover, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of Transformer\\nand CNN architectures, and further discuss the performance, key\\nfeatures, and limitations of both Transformer Neck (DETR-like\\nmodels) and Transformer Backbone (ViT-like models).\\n2. We comprehensively compare mainstream models on the same\\ndataset, establish a benchmark based on the COCO2017 dataset,\\nand offer insightful discussions.\\n3. We present an in-depth analysis of the transition as Transformer\\narchitecture extends from sequence to visual tasks. Furthermore,\\nwe discuss the future development of Transformer and CNN\\napproaches in object detection.\\nThe rest structure of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2\\nintroduces the main object detection datasets and evaluation metrics,\\nas well as the Attention mechanism and Transformer basic architecture.\\nSection 3 outlines the current mainstream Transformer-based object de-\\ntectors. Section 4 discusses the methods of these models in a multi-level\\ncomparison. Section 5 concludes the paper with an outlook.\\n2. Transformer architecture\\nTransformer is an architecture based on the attention mechanism\\nproposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in 2017, which was initially used\\nfor machine translation tasks and subsequently achieved great success\\nin NLP (Devlin et al., 2018). The success of Transformer is attributed\\nFig. 2. Transformer structure. The Input Embedding module of Transformer encoder\\n(left column) can map the input sequence to Embedding space and pass it to encoder\\nmodule for processing. The Transformer decoder (right column) receives the previous\\noutput sequence and the output sequence from the intermediate encoder. The previous\\noutput sequence will be shifted one bit to the right, and the start token will be appended\\nbefore the sequence to get the input from the decoder. The feed-forward network and\\nthe multi-head attention module are repeated 𝑁times to form the encoder and decoder.\\nto its unique architecture, whose core design is the Encoder–Decoder\\nstructure based on self-attention. As shown in Fig. 2, Transformer con-\\nsists of three main blocks: multi-headed attention, positional encoding,\\nand feed-forward network. Multi-head attention (MHA) block and Feed-\\nforward network block are the main modules of Encoder and Decoder.\\nPosition encoding is a vital module to all Transformer variants and is\\nresponsible for attaching position information to the input sequence. In\\nthis section, these fundamental techniques are described in detail.\\n2.1. Basic architecture\\nThe structure of Transformer is based on encoder–decoder. The\\nencoder consists of 𝑁basic encoder modules, as shown in Fig. 2. Every\\nencoder module consists of a multi-head attention module (MHA) and a\\nfeed-forward network (FFN). And then, they are cascaded with residual\\nconnection and layer normalization one by one. Finally, the output of\\nthe encoder module is shown in Eq. (1):\\n𝑂𝑢𝑡𝑝𝑢𝑡= 𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚(𝑥+ 𝑆𝑢𝑏𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟(𝑥)),\\n(1)\\nwhere 𝑥is the input sequence, and 𝑆𝑢𝑏𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟represents the attention\\nmodule or feedforward network.\\n2.2. Self-attention\\n2.2.1. Scaled dot-product attention\\nThe self-attention mechanism module, as the core component of\\nTransformer, consists of two main parts: (1) Linear projection layer:\\nthe input sequence is mapped into 3 different vectors (query 𝑄, key\\n𝐾, value 𝑉). The input sequences are 𝑋∈R𝑛𝑥×𝑑𝑥and 𝑌∈R𝑛𝑦×𝑑𝑦,\\nEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107021\\n3\\nY. Li et al.\\nFig. 3. (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of\\nseveral attention layers running in parallel.\\nwhere 𝑛and 𝑑denote the length and dimension of the input sequence,\\nrespectively. Then 𝑄, 𝐾, and 𝑉are generated as follows:\\n𝑄= 𝑋𝑊𝑄,\\n𝐾= 𝑌𝑊𝐾,\\n𝑉= 𝑌𝑊𝑉,\\n(2)\\nwhere 𝑊𝑄∈R𝑑𝑥×𝑑𝑞, 𝑊𝐾∈R𝑑𝑦×𝑑𝑘and 𝑊𝑉∈R𝑑𝑦×𝑑𝑣are the learnable\\nweight matrices. The 𝑑𝑞and 𝑑𝑘denotes the dimensions of 𝑊𝑄and 𝑊𝐾,\\nrespectively. The dimension of 𝑊𝑉is 𝑑𝑣. When 𝑋= 𝑌, Eq. (2) is the\\nself-attention computation, and when 𝑋≠𝑌, it is the cross-attention\\ncomputation in the Decoder module.\\n(2) Attention layer: Transformer adopts a special attention method\\ncalled Scaled Dot-Product Attention, as shown in Fig. 3 (left). The\\ninput consists of 𝑄in 𝑑𝑞dimensions, 𝐾in 𝑑𝑘dimensions and 𝑉in\\n𝑑𝑣dimensions, and the scaled attention matrix is calculated as shown\\nin Eq. (3).\\nAttention (𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = softmax\\n(\\n𝑄𝐾𝑇\\n√\\n𝑑𝑘\\n)\\n𝑉,\\n(3)\\nwhere\\n1\\n√\\n𝑑𝑘is the scaling factor. The attention weights are obtained by\\ncomputing the dot product of Q for all K. The attention weights are then\\nnormalized by the scaling factor\\n1\\n√\\n𝑑𝑘and the softmax layer. The output\\nweights are assigned to the corresponding elements of V to obtain the\\nfinal attention matrix.\\n2.2.2. Multi-head attention\\nHowever, the modeling ability of single-head attention is weak.\\nTo address this problem, Vaswani et al. (2017) proposed multi-head\\nattention (MHA). The structure is shown in Fig. 3 (right). MHA can\\nenhance the modeling ability of each attention layer without changing\\nthe number of parameters.\\nCompared to single-head attention, MHA maps Q, K, and V linearly\\nto different dimensional subspaces (𝑑𝑞, 𝑑𝑘, 𝑑𝑣) to compute similarity and\\ncompute the attention function in parallel. As shown in Eq. (4), the\\nresulting vectors are concatenated and mapped again to obtain the final\\noutput.\\nMultiHead(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = Concat ( head 1, … , head h\\n) 𝑊𝑂,\\nwhere head i = Attention\\n(\\n𝑄𝑊𝑄\\n𝑖, 𝐾𝑊𝐾\\n𝑖, 𝑉𝑊𝑉\\n𝑖\\n)\\n,\\n(4)\\nwhere 𝑊𝑄\\n𝑖\\n∈R𝑑model ×𝑑𝑞, 𝑊𝐾\\n𝑖\\n∈R𝑑model ×𝑑𝑘, 𝑊𝑉\\n𝑖\\n∈R𝑑model × 𝑑𝑣, 𝑊𝑂\\n𝑖\\n∈\\nR𝑑model ×ℎ𝑑𝑣is the projection parameter matrix. Multi-head attention\\nreduces the dimensionality of each vector when calculating the atten-\\ntion of each head, which reduces overfitting to a certain extent. Since\\nattention has different distributions in different subspaces, this module\\nfuses the feature relationships between different sequence dimensions\\nin vector concatenation.\\n2.3. Position-wise feed-forward networks\\nThe output of the MHA layer is fed into the feed-forward network\\n(FFN). FFN is mainly composed of two linear transformations with a\\nRuLU activation in between. The output of FFN can be expressed as\\nshown in Eq. (5):\\nFFN(𝑥) = max (0, 𝑥𝑊1 + 𝑏1\\n) 𝑊2 + 𝑏2,\\n(5)\\nwhere 𝑊1 and 𝑊2 denote weight matrices of the two fully connected\\nlayers.\\n2.4. Positional encoding\\nUnlike CNN and RNN, self-attention computation brings the ad-\\nvantage of parallel computing while losing word order information.\\nTherefore, positional encoding is used to provide positional information\\nto the model. In detail, a position-dependent signal is added to each\\nword embedding for each input sequence to help the model incorporate\\nthe order of words. The output of positional encoding has the same\\ndimension as the embedding layer. So it can be superimposed directly\\non Embedding. The positional information of each token (a sequence\\nof primitives obtained after the text has been divided into words) and\\nits semantic information (Embedding) are fully integrated and passed\\nto the subsequent layer.\\nThere are many variants of positional encoding. The original Trans-\\nformer uses sine and cosine functions for positional encoding, as shown\\nin Eq. (6).\\n𝑃𝐸(𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖) = sin (𝑝𝑜𝑠∕100002𝑖∕𝑑model ) ,\\n𝑃𝐸(𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖+1) = cos (𝑝𝑜𝑠∕100002𝑖∕𝑑model ) ,\\n(6)\\nwhere 𝑝𝑜𝑠is the position and 𝑖is the dimension. That is, each dimension\\nof the position encoding corresponds to a sine wave. The wavelengths\\nform a geometric progression from 2𝜋to 10000×2𝜋. For any fixed offset\\n𝑘, 𝑃𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠+𝑘can be represented as a linear function of 𝑃𝐸𝑝𝑜𝑠.\\n2.5. Remarks\\nThe self-attention mechanism allows Transformer to break through\\nthe limitation that RNN models cannot be computed in parallel and\\nimprove the computational efficiency. Compared with CNN, the self-\\nattentive mechanism has a global perceptual field. The number of\\noperations required to compute the association between two locations\\ndoes not grow with distance, so it has a stronger ability to learn long-\\nrange dependencies. In addition, Transformer has a general modeling\\ncapability. Transformer can be regarded as a fully connected graph\\nmodeling method that can model heterogeneous nodes by projecting\\nthem into a comparable space to compute similarity. Therefore, there is\\na sufficient theoretical basis for using Transformer for various computer\\nvision tasks based on its general modeling capability. Considering\\nthe dimensional differences between images and text, the images are\\nconverted into sequences and can then be input into the model for\\nprocessing.\\nMoreover, we compare the characteristics of CNN and Transformer.\\nAs shown in Table 1, Transformer tends to model shapes more but\\nrequires massive data for training. In contrast, CNN tends to model local\\ntextures more but has to pile many convolutional layers to have a large\\nenough receptive field to get global information (Geirhos et al., 2019).\\n3. Transformer for object detection\\nThis section first introduces common datasets and evaluation met-\\nrics for object detection and analyzes classic Transformer-based object\\ndetectors. According to their structural difference, We classify the\\nlisted detectors as Transformer Neck-based detectors and Transformer\\nBackbone-based detectors. The Transformer Neck-based detector infers\\nthe class labels and bounding box coordinates with a set of learnable\\nobject queries but does not change the backbone used for feature\\nextraction. Transformer Backbone-based detectors propose a generic\\nvisual backbone that flattens the image into a sequence instead of\\nconvolution for feature extraction. Multiscale feature fusion is also\\nEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107021\\n4\\nY. Li et al.\\nTable 1\\nSummary of the highlights and limitations of CNN and Transformer.\\nArchitecture\\nHighlights\\nLimitations\\nTransformer\\n(1) The attention mechanism\\namplifies the significance of crucial\\naspects of an image while reducing\\nthe rest, thereby concentrating on\\nmore relevant features. This\\nmechanism assists the Transformer in\\nmodeling the long-range\\ndependencies of input sequence\\nelements and thus enhances its\\ngeneralization ability for samples\\noutside the distribution (Bai et al.,\\n2021).

In reviewing these\\nmethods, we summarize the optimization innovations or modules of the\\ndifferent methods. Finally, we compare their performance in Table 4\\nand Table 5 and give analyzation and discussion on improvements of\\nthe above methods.\\n3.1. Common datasets and evaluation metrics\\n3.1.1. Common datasets for object detection\\nDatasets are the basis for measuring and comparing algorithm\\nperformance. The commonly used object detection datasets are Pas-\\ncal VOC2007(Everingham et al., 2007), Pascal VOC2012(Everingham\\net al., 2012) and Microsoft COCO2017(Lin et al., 2014), as shown in\\nTable 2. The Pascal VOC dataset has only 20 object categories and is\\nregarded as a benchmark dataset for object detection. Compared with\\nVOC, the COCO dataset has more small objects and more objects in\\na single image, and most of the objects are non-centrally distributed\\nand more similar to the real environment. Thus COCO dataset is\\nmore difficult for object detection and has been the mainstream object\\ndetection dataset in recent years.\\n3.1.2. Evaluation metrics\\nCommon evaluation metrics for object detection include Precision,\\nRecall, Average Precision (AP), and mean Average Precision (mAP). In\\naddition to classification, the object detection task localizes the object\\nfurther with a bounding box associated with its corresponding confi-\\ndence score to report how certain the bounding box of the object class\\nis detected. Therefore to determine how many objects were detected\\ncorrectly and how many false positives were generated, we use the\\nIntersection over Union (IoU) metric.\\nIntersection over Union (IoU). IoU is an evaluation metric that\\nquantifies the similarity between the ground truth bounding box\\n(𝑔𝑡𝑏𝑜𝑥) and the predicted bounding box (𝑝𝑑𝑏𝑜𝑥) to evaluate how good\\nthe predicted box is. The IoU score ranges from 0 to 1; the closer the\\ntwo boxes, the higher the IoU score. It can be calculated as follow:\\n𝐼𝑜𝑈(𝑔𝑡, 𝑝𝑑) = area(𝑔𝑡𝑏𝑜𝑥∩𝑝𝑑𝑏𝑜𝑥)\\narea(𝑔𝑡𝑏𝑜𝑥∪𝑝𝑑𝑏𝑜𝑥) ,\\n(7)\\nFor the IoU threshold at 𝛼, True Positive(TP) is a detection for\\nwhich 𝐼𝑜𝑈(𝑔𝑡, 𝑝𝑑) ≥𝛼and False Positive (FP) is a detection for which\\n𝐼𝑜𝑈(𝑔𝑡, 𝑝𝑑) ≤𝛼. False Negative (FN) is a ground-truth missed together\\nwith 𝑔𝑡for which 𝐼𝑜𝑈(𝑔𝑡, 𝑝𝑑) ≤𝛼. The definitions of TP, TN, FP and FN\\nare shown in Table 3.\\nPrecision. Precision is the probability of the predicted bounding\\nboxes matching actual ground truth boxes, also referred to as the\\npositive predictive value. Precision scores range from 0 to 1, with a\\nhigh precision implying that most detected objects match ground truth\\nobjects.\\nRecall. Recall is the true positive rate, also referred to as sensitivity,\\nwhich measures the probability of ground truth objects being correctly\\ndetected. Similarly, Recall ranges from 0 to 1, where a high recall score\\nmeans that most ground truth objects were detected.\\nThe Precision and Recall can be calculated as follow:\\nPrecision =\\nTP\\nTP + FP ,\\n(8)\\nRecall =\\nTP\\nTP + FN ,\\n(9)\\nAverage precision (AP). AP is Area Under the Precision–Recall\\nCurve evaluated at a specific IoU threshold. AP is a single number\\nmetric that combines precision and recall and describes the Accuracy–\\nRecall curve by AP among recall values ranging from 0 to 1. It is used\\nto evaluate the performance of object detectors.\\nEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107021\\n5\\nY.

Transformer neck\\nIn this section, we review the classic Transformer Neck-based ob-\\nject detection models in last two years, starting from the original\\nTransformer detector DETR (Carion et al., 2020). The original DETR\\nregards object detection as end-to-end set prediction, thus removing\\nhand-designed components such as anchor boxes and non-maximum\\nsuppression (NMS). However, some drawbacks need to be solved in\\nDETR, such as slow convergence and poor detection of small objects.\\nTherefore, many approaches (sparse attention, spatial prior acceler-\\nation, multi-scale detection) have been proposed to improve it by\\nresearchers. We compare the performance of all methods together on\\nthe COCO2017 dataset with the benchmark shown in Table 4.\\n3.2.1. DETR\\nDETR proposed by Carion et al. (2020) is the first object detector\\nthat successfully uses the Transformer as the main module in object\\ndetection. DETR not only has a simpler and more flexible structure\\nbut also has comparable performance compared to previous SOTA\\napproaches, such as the highly optimized Faster R-CNN. Unlike classical\\nobject detectors, DETR is an end-to-end object detection model. It gets\\nrid of the autoregressive model, performs parallel inference on object\\nrelationships and global image context, and then outputs the final\\npredictions. The structure of DETR is shown in Fig. 4.\\nDETR treats the object detection task as an intuitive set prediction\\nproblem and discards some traditional hand-craft components such as\\nhand-designed anchor sets and non-maximal suppression (NMS). As\\nshown in Fig. 4, DETR uses CNN Backbone to learn the 2D features\\nof the input image. Then feature maps are unfolded into sequences and\\nfed to the Transformer encoder module (where there is still positional\\nencoding). The output of the Transformer Decoder module is then\\nobtained under the constraint of object queries. Finally, the class and\\nbounding box regression parameters are obtained after a feedforward\\nnetwork.\\nBased on the idea of sequential prediction, DETR regards the predic-\\ntion of the network as a fixed sequence ̃𝑦of length N, ̃𝑦= ̃𝑦𝑖, 𝑖∈(1, 𝑁),\\n(where the value of 𝑁is fixed and much larger than the number of\\nGround Truth in the image), ̃𝑦𝑖= (̃𝑐𝑖, ̃𝑏𝑖\\n). Meanwhile, the Ground Truth\\nis considered as a sequence 𝑦∶𝑦𝑖= (𝑐𝑖, 𝑏𝑖\\n) (the length must be less\\nthan N, so the sequence is filled with 𝜙(for no object), which can be\\ninterpreted as the category of background, to make its length equal to\\nN), where 𝑐𝑖denotes the true category to which the object belongs,\\nand 𝑏𝑖denotes a quaternion (containing the center point coordinates\\nand the width and height of the object box, and both are relative to\\nthe scale coordinates of the image).\\nSo the prediction task can be viewed as a bipartite matching prob-\\nlem between 𝑦and ̃𝑦, with the Hungarian algorithm as the solution\\nmethod, defining the strategy for minimum matching as follows:\\n̂𝜎= arg min\\n𝜎∈S𝑁\\n𝑁\\n∑\\n𝑖\\nLmatch\\n(𝑦𝑖, ̂𝑦𝜎(𝑖)\\n) ,\\n(11)\\nwhere ̃𝜎denotes the matching strategy when finding the minimum\\nloss, for L while considering the similarity prediction between Ground\\nTruth boxes. For 𝜎(𝑖), 𝑐𝑖the predicted category confidence is ̃𝑃𝜎(𝑖)\\n(𝑐𝑖\\n)\\nand the bounding box prediction is ̃𝑏𝜎(𝑖), for non-empty matches, define\\nLmatch\\n(𝑦𝑖, ̂𝑦𝜎(𝑖)\\n) as: −1{𝑐𝑖≠∅} ̂𝑝𝜎(𝑖)\\n(𝑐𝑖\\n) + 1{𝑐𝑖≠∅}Lbox\\n(𝑏𝑖, ̂𝑏𝜎(𝑖)\\n).\\nIn this way, the overall loss is obtained as\\nLHungarian (𝑦, ̂𝑦) =\\n𝑁\\n∑\\n𝑖=1\\n[\\n−log ̂𝑝̂𝜎(𝑖)\\n(𝑐𝑖\\n) + 1{𝑐𝑖≠∅}Lbox\\n(𝑏𝑖, ̂𝑏̂𝜎(𝑖))]\\n,\\n(12)\\nConsidering the bounding box scale, the 𝐿1 loss and the IoU loss are\\nlinearly combined to obtain the L𝑏𝑜𝑥loss:\\nL𝑏𝑜𝑥= 𝜆iou Liou\\n(𝑏𝑖, ̂𝑏𝜎(𝑖)\\n) + 𝜆L1 ‖‖‖𝑏𝑖−̂𝑏𝜎(𝑖)‖‖‖1 ,\\n(13)\\nEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107021\\n6\\nY.

Attention\\nvisualization in the encoder demonstrates how the model concentrates\\non specific regions of the image, emphasizing crucial areas that con-\\ntribute to the comprehension of the objects present. The decoder uses\\nthe encoded features to generate final object detections, employing a\\nseries of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms to iteratively\\nrefine the predicted object bounding boxes and class labels.\\nIn summary, DETR, the first Transformer-based end-to-end object\\ndetector, exhibited performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA)\\nmethods at the time. However, there are evident drawbacks in its\\napplication: slow convergence and low accuracy on small objects.\\nNonetheless, its end-to-end architecture possesses significant potential\\nand has attracted numerous researchers to explore improvements.\\n3.2.2.

To address the above issues, Dai et al. (2021a)\\nproposed UP-DETR, a DETR-like model capable of unsupervised pre-\\ntraining, whose structure is shown in Fig. 7.\\nMultiple query patches are randomly cropped from a given image\\nand the Transformer for detection is pre-trained to predict the bounding\\nboxes of these query patches in the given image.

YOLOS\\nInspired by the pre-trained Transformer can fine-tune at the token\\nlevel tasks (Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Sang and De Meulder, 2003), Fang\\net al. (2021) proposed YOLOS, a pure sequence-to-sequence trans-\\nformer on the basis of DETR (Carion et al., 2020) and ViT (Dosovitskiy\\net al., 2021). It replaces the class token of the original ViT with the\\ndetection token and replaces the image classification loss with the\\nbipartite matching loss of DETR in the training phase, which allows\\nobject detection by set prediction. YOLOS demonstrates the generality\\nand transferability of the pre-trained Transformer from image classi-\\nfication to downstream object detection task, which is pre-trained in\\nthe classification task and then transfer to the detection task for fine-\\ntuning. Experiments demonstrate that YOLOS-Base, pre-trained on only\\nmedium-sized ImageNet datasets can achieve 42.0 box AP.\\n3.2.4. Deformable DETR\\nInspired by Deformable Convolution ((Dai et al., 2017), Zhu et al.\\n(2021) proposed Deformable DETR. This method combines the ad-\\nvantages of sparse spatial sampling of deformable convolution with\\nthe relational modeling capability of Transformer. The Deformable\\nAttention Module (DEM) is introduced to accelerate convergence and\\nfuse multi-scale features to improve accuracy. Moreover, The authors\\nintroduce multi-scale feature from FPN (Lin et al., 2016), and then\\npropose Multi-Scale Deformable Attention (MSDA) to replace the Trans-\\nformer Attention Module for processing feature maps, as shown in\\nFig. 8 is shown. Let {𝒙𝑙}𝐿\\n𝑙=1 be the input multi-scale feature map, where\\n𝑥𝑙∈R𝐶×𝐻𝑙×𝑊𝑙. Let ̂𝒑𝑞∈[0, 1]2 be the normalized coordinates of the\\nreference point of each query element 𝑞, and then compute Multi-Scale\\nDeformable Attention as\\nDeformAttn (𝒛𝑞, 𝒑𝑞, 𝒙) =\\n𝑀\\n∑\\n𝑚=1\\n𝑾𝑚\\n[ 𝐾\\n∑\\n𝑘=1\\n𝐴𝑚𝑞𝑘⋅𝑾′\\n𝑚𝒙(𝒑𝑞+ 𝛥𝒑𝑚𝑞𝑘\\n)\\n]\\n,\\n(14)\\nwhere 𝑚is the index of attention head, 𝑙is the index of input feature\\nlevel, and k is the index of sampling points. 𝛥𝒑𝑚𝑙𝑞𝑘and 𝐴𝑚𝑙𝑞𝑘denote\\nrespectively sampling offset and attention weight of the 𝑘th sampling\\npoint in the 𝑙th feature layer and the 𝑚th attention head. The scalar\\nattention weights 𝐴𝑚𝑙𝑞𝑘are normalized to ∑𝐿\\n𝑙=1\\n∑𝐾\\n𝑘=1 𝐴𝑚𝑙𝑞𝑘= 1. The\\nnormalized coordinates (0, 0) and (1, 1) of ̂𝒑𝑞∈[0, 1]2 denote the upper\\nleft and lower right corners of the image, respectively. The function\\n𝜙𝑙\\n(̂𝒑𝑞\\n) in Eq. (14) rescales the normalized coordinates 𝑷𝑞to the input\\nfeature map of the 𝑙th layer. The computational complexity of MSDA\\nis 𝑂(2𝑁𝑞𝐶2 + min (𝐻𝑊𝐶2, 𝑁𝑞𝐾𝐶2)) compared to the original DETR,\\nDeformable DETR requires less than one-tenth of training epochs to\\nachieve better performance (especially on small object).\\n3.2.5. Conditional DETR\\nMeng et al. (2021) proposed Conditional DETR. They visualized ex-\\nperiments on the operation of DETR and concluded that cross-attention\\nin DETR is highly dependent on content embedding to locate the\\nfour vertices and predict the bounding box. Thus, it increases the\\ntraining difficulty. So they improved the cross-attention of DETR by\\nconcatenating the content query 𝑐𝑞and spatial query 𝑝𝑞, and the key\\nby splicing the content key 𝑐𝑘and spatial key 𝑝𝑘. This inner product of\\nquery and key gives the following result:\\n𝐜⊤\\n𝑞𝐜𝑘+ 𝐩⊤\\n𝑞𝐩𝑘,\\n(15)\\nThis separates the functions of content query and spatial query\\nso that they focus on the weight of content and space respectively.\\nAs shown in Fig. 9, the improved Decoder layer consists of three\\nmain modules: 1) The self-attention layer, which is from the previous\\nDecoder layer and is used to remove duplicate predictions as well as\\npredict categories and bounding boxes; (2) The cross-attention layer,\\nwhich can use embedding output of encoder to complete the embedding\\nof the decoder; (3) The feed-forward networks layer (FFN).\\nThe core of the conditional cross-attention mechanism is to learn\\na conditional spatial query from decoder embedding and reference\\npoints, which can explicitly find the boundary regions of the object,\\nthus narrowing down the search object, helping to locate the object,\\nand alleviating the problem of over-reliance on the quality of content\\nembedding in DETR training. The problem of over-reliance on the\\nquality of content embedding in DETR training is alleviated. These\\nrefinements improve the convergence speed of DETR by 8× faster and\\nthe box mAP on the COCO dataset by 1.8%.\\n3.2.6. Efficient DETR\\nYao et al. analyzed the mechanisms of DETR and Deformable DETR\\nand found that their common feature is a cascade structure stacked\\nwith six Decoders, which is used to iteratively update the object query.\\nThe reference point proposed by Deformable DETR visualizes the object\\nquery and solves the difficult problem that the object query is difficult\\nto analyze directly. However, different initialization methods of refer-\\nence points have a great impact on decoder performance. In order to\\ninvestigate a more efficient way to initialize the object container, Yao\\net al. proposed Efficient DETR, a two-stage object detector that consists\\nof dense prediction and sparse set prediction, and these two parts share\\nthe same detection head.\\nThe model generates region proposals using dense detection before\\ninitializing the object container, and then uses the highest-scoring 4-\\ndimensional proposal and its 256-dimensional encoder features as the\\ninitialization value of the object container, which results in better\\nperformance and fast convergence. The experimental results show that\\nEfficient DETR combines the features of dense detection and ensemble\\ndetection, and can converge quickly while achieving high performance.\\nThe model achieves the SOTA performance at that time on the COCO\\ndataset with only one encoder layer and three decoder layers, while the\\nepoch is reduced by 14× less.\\n3.2.7. SMCA\\nTo strengthen the relationship between the visual region of common\\ninterest for each object query and the bounding box to be predicted by\\nthe query, Gao et al. (2021) introduced spatial prior and multi-scale fea-\\ntures, and proposed Spatially Modulated Co Attention (SMCA), which\\nreplaces the cross attention in the original Decoder while keeping the\\nothers unchanged.\\nThe decoder of SMCA has multiple cross-attention heads, each of\\nwhich estimates the object center and scale from a slightly different\\nlocation, resulting in a series of different spatial weight maps. This\\nweight map is used to spatially adjust the co-attention features, which\\nimproves the detection performance. Based on these improvements,\\nSMCA can achieve 43.7 mAP in 50 epochs and 45.6 mAP in 108 epochs\\non the COCO dataset.\\n3.2.8. ACT\\nDue to the slow convergence of DETR, Zheng et al. (2021) proposed\\nthe Adaptive Clustering Transformer (ACT) to address the problem of\\nhigh trial and error costs for improving DETR. ACT is a plug-and-\\nplay module that is fully compatible with Transformer and can be\\nported to DETR without any training. Its core design is first, to perform\\nfeature clustering adaptively for the attention redundancy (points with\\nsimilar semantics and similar spatial locations produce similar atten-\\ntion maps) of encoder, select representative prototypes, and broadcast\\nfeature updates to their nearest neighboring points based on Euclidean\\ndistance. Second, an adaptive clustering algorithm is designed for the\\nencoder note feature diversity problem (for different inputs, the feature\\ndistribution of each encoder layer is quite different), and a multi-\\nround exact Euclidean location-sensitive hash (E2LSH) is chosen for this\\nalgorithm to adaptively determine the number of prototypes.

(2021).\\nto these improvements, ACT can reduce the FLOPS of DETR from\\n73.4 Gflops to 58.2 Gflops (excluding Backbone Resnet FLOPs) without\\nadditional training, while the loss of AP is only 0.7%. The AP loss\\ncan be further reduced to 0.2% by multitasking knowledge distillation.\\nGiven its excellent performance, exploring ACT training from scratch\\nand fusion with multi-scale features is a worthy research direction in\\nthe future.\\n3.2.9. TSP\\nSun et al. (2021) concluded after a lot of analysis that the cross-\\nattention part of decoder and Hungarian loss of DETR are the main\\nreasons for the slow convergence of DETR. So they proposed two\\nimproved models of DETR with only encoder, TSP-FCOS and TSP-\\nRCNN corresponding to the One-Stage and Two-Stage object detection\\nmethods, respectively. Both models can be viewed as feature pyra-\\nmid (Lin et al., 2016) based. The model uses a feature of interest (FoI)\\nselection mechanism that helps encoder process multi-scale features. In\\naddition, the model applies matching distillation to solve the instability\\nof bipartite graph matching. Experiments show that TSP achieves better\\nresults with reduced training cost, using only 36-epoch to achieve the\\n500-epoch results of the original DETR training.\\n3.2.10. DINO\\nThe Hungarian algorithm has been used in DETR (Carion et al.,\\n2020) to match the output of the object by Decoder with Ground Truth.\\nHowever, the discreteness of the Hungarian algorithm matching and\\nthe randomness of the model training cause the matching process to be\\ndynamic and unstable, resulting the final slow convergence of DETR.\\nBy deeply studying the iteration mechanism and optimization prob-\\nlems of the DETR model, Zhang et al. (2022a)proposed DINO (DETR\\nwith Improved deNoising anchor boxes) based on DN-DETR (Li et al.,\\n2022), DAB-DETR (Liu et al., 2022a) and Deformable DETR (Zhu et al.,\\n2021). The key design of DINO is that the training phase uses denoising\\ntraining as a shortcut to learning the relative offset of anchor by first\\nadding noise near the Ground Truth box, and then the Hungarian\\nmatching directly reconstructs the truth bounding box, thus improving\\nthe stability of matching. Secondly, the model also uses a query-based\\nEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107021\\n10\\nY. Li et al.\\nFig. 10.

Moreover, DINO-Swin-L\\neven achieves the highest performance 63.3AP after training on a larger\\ndataset.\\n3.3. Transformer backbone\\nOther efforts such as ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have used Trans-\\nformer in the image classification and achieved comparable results.\\nHowever, there are some limitations in other complex CV tasks. These\\nchallenges of transferring the high performance of Transformer in NLP\\nto the CV can be explained by the differences between the two domains.\\n1. The object entities in CV tasks often have dramatic scale varia-\\ntion.\\n2. Compared to text, the matrix nature of images makes it con-\\ntain at least hundreds of pixels for an image that can express\\ninformation. Especially the very long sequence unfolded by high-\\nresolution images is difficult for Transformer to model.\\n3. Many CV tasks such as semantic segmentation require pixel-level\\ndense prediction, and the computational complexity of the self-\\nattention mechanism in ViT increases quadratically with image\\nsize, which leads to unacceptable computational overhead.\\n4. In the existing Transformer-based models, tokens are fixed in\\nscale and not improved in design for CV tasks.\\nTo address the above challenges, many Transformer-based back-\\nbones have been proposed for CV tasks and combined with methods\\nsuch as multi-scale to compensate for the shortcomings that ViT can\\nonly detect at low resolution and so on. These methods can replace the\\nbackbone of mainstream object detection models, and in the benchmark\\nTable 5, we list the performance of Mask R-CNN (He et al., 2017)\\nand RetinaNet (Ross and Dollár, 2017) comparison after replacing the\\nbackbone and review the classical models in this subsection.\\n3.3.1. PVT&PVTv2\\nThe feature maps output by ViT (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) are\\ndifficult to apply to dense prediction due to their single scale and low\\nresolution. Wang et al. (2021a) proposed the Pyramid Vision Trans-\\nformer (PVT) by incorporating the multi-scale feature into Transformer.\\nPVT can be used as a Backbone for various dense detection tasks,\\nespecially it can replace the CNN backbone of DETR-like models or be\\ncombined into a pure Transformer model without manual components\\nsuch as NMS.\\nBenefiting from the progressive shrinking pyramid structure in the\\nPVT, the Transformer sequence length decreases as the network gets\\ndeeper. Meanwhile, in order to further reduce the computation of\\nfine-grained segmentation of images, they propose spatial-reduction\\nattention (SRA) to reduce the computation of learning high-resolution\\nfeature maps (As shown in Fig. 10).\\nCompared with the CNN method based on feature pyramid struc-\\nture, PVT not only generates multi-scale feature maps to detect ob-\\njects of different sizes but also fuses global information through self-\\nattention mechanism. The PVTv2 (Wang et al., 2022) proposed by\\nthe same team subsequently improves the PVT by adding a linear\\ncomplexity attention layer, overlapping patch embedding, and convo-\\nlutional feed-forward network to improve the performance of the PVT\\nas backbone. On the COCO dataset, both achieved competitive results\\nat that time.\\n3.3.2. Swin transformer\\nLiu et al. (2021b) proposed Swin Transformer, which creatively uses\\na hierarchical design to make the Transformer available as a backbone\\nfor most CV tasks, rather than just a detection head. As shown in\\nFig. 11, It is easy to see that, unlike other Transformer models, Swin\\nTransformer builds a feature map with hierarchical representation,\\nsimilar to the feature pyramid structure in CNN. As the network level\\ndeepens, the receptive expands, enabling the extraction of multi-scale\\nfeatures of the image. Secondly, Swin Transformer divides the feature\\nmap with multiple windows, and each non-overlapping window per-\\nforms local multi-head attention calculation without correspondence\\nbetween windows, which makes the computation greatly reduced and\\nlinear with the image size, as shown in the Eq. (16). In contrast, ViT\\nproduces a single low-resolution image and calculates global attention,\\nEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107021\\n11\\nY. Li et al.\\nFig. 11. Compare Swin Transformer (left) with ViT (right).\\nSource: Image form Liu et al. (2021b).\\nso the computational complexity and image size are quadratically\\nrelated, as shown in Eq. (17)\\n𝛺(W −MSA) = 4ℎ𝑤𝐶2 + 2𝑀2ℎ𝑤𝐶,\\n(16)\\n𝛺(MSA) = 4ℎ𝑤𝐶2 + 2(ℎ𝑤)2𝐶,\\n(17)\\nwhere M is a fixed window size (set to 7 by default), computing global\\nattention for ViT is unacceptable for large image sizes 𝐻𝑊, while\\nwindow-based multi-head self-attention (W-MSA) is scalable.\\nThe Pipeline of the Swin Transformer is shown in Fig. 12(a). The\\ninput image is spreading into a sequence after Patch Partition and\\nLinear Embedding layers, and then input into 4 stages. The Swin\\nTransformer block in each stage replaces the standard multi-head self-\\nattention (MSA) module in the Transformer module with window-based\\nself-attention (W-MSA) or a shift window-based module (SW-MSA),\\nwhich introduces a relative position bias in the computation of at-\\ntention to account for the geometric relationships in the self-attention\\ncomputation, as shown in Eq. (18). This parameter accounts for the\\nrelative spatial configuration of the visual elements and is shown to be\\ncritical in various visual tasks, especially for intensive recognition tasks\\nsuch as object detection and semantic segmentation.\\nAttention(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = SoftMax\\n(\\n𝑄𝐾𝑇∕\\n√\\n𝑑+ 𝐵\\n)\\n𝑉,\\n(18)\\nAlthough W-MSA reduces the computation greatly, W-MSA loses the\\nability to model the relationship between different windows, and the\\nlack of information exchange between non-overlapping windows affects\\nthe representation of the model. So they introduced SW-MSA, which\\nshifts the windows in the Swin Transformer Block of the next layer to\\nintroduce correspondence of the previous layer. This operation greatly\\nincreases the actual receptive field, as shown in Fig. 13. In this way,\\nthe multi-head attention is computed inside the new window to include\\nthe boundary of the original window and achieve the modeling of the\\nrelationship between windows.\\nBut this approach causes the number of windows to change, and\\nthe window size is not uniform. An easy way to solve this problem\\nis padding the small window, but it will increase the computation. So\\nthey proposed cyclic-shifting, a more efficient method of batch com-\\nputation. This method cyclically shifts and merges small windows, so\\nthat a window may contain content from different windows, and there-\\nfore the masked MSA mechanism is used to restrict the self-attention\\ncomputation to each sub-window, as shown in Fig. 14.\\nSwin Transformer has achieved SOTA performance on classification,\\ndetection, and segmentation tasks. Its biggest contribution is to propose\\na backbone that can be widely used in CV. And most of the hyper-\\nparameters commonly found in CNNs can be manually tuned in Swin\\nTransformer, such as the number of network blocks and the size of input\\nimages. This method combines the advantages of both Transformer and\\nCNN, fully considers the size invariance of CNN and the relationship\\nbetween receptive field and number of layers, and solves the problem\\nof slow application of Transformer in CV.\\n3.3.3. Swin TransformerV2\\nAfter Swin Transformer, Liu et al. (2021a) proposed Swin Trans-\\nformerV2 to address the problems of expansion of CV models and\\ntraining with high-resolution images, as well as the excessive GPU\\nmemory consumption for large models. Swin Transformer is optimized\\nto scale up to 3 billion parameters and can be trained with images up\\nto 1536 × 1536 resolutions. The improved method is shown in Fig. 15.\\nPost normalization technique: They found that when scaling up\\nthe model, the activation values in the deep layer increase dramatically.\\nIn fact, in the pre-normalized configuration (Layer Norm layer before\\nthe Attention layer), the output activation values of each residual block\\nare directly merged back to the main branch, and the amplitude of the\\nmain branch becomes in the deeper layers. The huge amplitude differ-\\nences between different layers may cause training instability problems.\\nTherefore, they propose a post normalization technique, in which the\\noutput of each residual block is normalized before it is merged back\\ninto the main branch, and the amplitude of the main branch does not\\naccumulate as the number of layers deepens.\\nScaled cosine attention: In the original self-attention computation,\\nthe similarity terms of pixel pairs are computed as dot products of\\nqueries and keys vectors. However, when using this approach for\\nlarge visual models, the learned attention graph for some blocks and\\nattention heads is often dominated by several pixel pairs, especially\\nin post-normalization configurations. To alleviate this problem, the\\nauthors propose a scaled cosine attention (Scaled cosine attention)\\nmethod, which computes the number of attention pairs for a pixel pair\\n𝑖and 𝑗by a scaled cosine function:\\nSim (𝐪𝑖, 𝐤𝑗\\n) = cos (𝐪𝑖, 𝐤𝑗\\n) ∕𝜏+ 𝐵𝑖𝑗,\\n(19)\\nwhere 𝐵𝑖𝑗is the relative position bias between pixels 𝑖and 𝑗; 𝜏is a\\nlearnable scalar that cannot be shared across heads and layers. The 𝜏is\\nset to be greater than 0.01. The cosine function is naturally normalized\\nso that it can have milder attention values, which improves the stability\\nof large visual models and makes the model capacity easier to be scaled\\nup.\\nLog-spaced continuous position bias:They found that the original\\nrelative position encoding method was weak for scale generalization of\\nthe model, and proposed log-spaced continuous position bias so that\\nthe relative position bias can be transferred smoothly across windows at\\ndifferent resolutions, effectively transferring models pre-trained in low-\\nresolution images and windows to their higher resolution counterparts:\\n̂\\n𝛥𝑥= sign(𝑥) ⋅log(1 + |𝛥𝑥|),\\n̂\\n𝛥𝑦= sign(𝑦) ⋅log(1 + |𝛥𝑦|),\\n(20)\\nwhere 𝛿𝑥, 𝛿𝑦and ̂\\n𝛥𝑥, ̂\\n𝛥𝑦are the coordinates of linear scale and\\nlogarithmic space, respectively. The optimized resulting architecture\\nwas named Swin TransformerV2, and the model achieved a box/mask\\nmAP of 63.1/54 in the COCO2017 dataset.\\n3.3.4. Other representative methods\\nIn addition to the conventional approaches, our benchmark extends\\nto include comparisons with several cutting-edge techniques. ViL, in-\\ntroduced by Zhang et al. (2021), realizes a multi-scale configuration\\nthrough the sequential stacking of numerous ViT stages. Furthermore,\\nit enhances the attention mechanism, thus elevating both efficiency and\\nclassification performance. The Focal Transformer introduces the novel\\nFocal Self-Attention mechanism. This integrates both granular local and\\ncoarse global interactions, thereby ensuring the effective capturing of\\nboth proximal and distal visual dependencies.

Analysis and discussion for detectors\\nThis section provides a succinct review of conventional Transformer-\\nbased object detectors, offering a detailed performance comparison in\\nTables 4 and 5. Each method was evaluated using the NVIDIA A100\\nGPU and adhered to the DETR training protocol. The AdamW opti-\\nmizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017) was uniformly employed across all\\nmethods, with the initial learning rate for the transformer set to 10−4,\\nthe backbone’s to 10−5, and weight decay at 10−4. The transformer\\nweights were initialized with Xavier init (Glorot and Bengio, 2010),\\nwhile the backbone leveraged the ImageNet-pretrained ResNet model\\nfrom torchvision, with frozen batch normalization layers.\\nFor Transformer Neck-based models, they treat object detection as\\na straightforward set prediction, removing manual components (such\\nas anchor set and NMS) that cannot be optimized, thus enabling end-\\nto-end detection. Starting from the original DETR with slow conver-\\ngence and poor detection of small objects, subsequent researchers have\\nproposed optimization strategies from different perspectives.\\n1. To address the problem of slow convergence, researchers often\\nstart by improving the attention mechanism. Deformable DETR (Zhu\\net al., 2021) accelerates convergence 12× faster with the Deformable\\nAttention Module. Conditional DETR improves the cross-attention of\\nDETR and gets 8× faster convergence. Meanwhile, the box mAP on\\nthe COCO dataset is improved by 1.8%. Unlike the above methods,\\nACT (Zheng et al., 2021) proposes a plug-and-play module for adaptive\\nclustering, which reduces the GFLOPS of DETR by 15.2 without addi-\\ntional training, while the AP loss is only 0.7%. Sparse DETR achieves\\nhigher performance and the same detection speed (FPS) as Faster\\nR-CNN by improving and reducing the GFLOPs by 75.\\n2. For the problem of poor detection of small objects, multi-scale\\nfeature is currently the main focus. Methods such as SMCA (Gao et al.,\\n2021) (as shown in Table 4) introduce multi-scale feature with different\\noperations and significantly improve the accuracy of the detector.\\nMoreover, DINO (Zhang et al., 2022a) reaches 63.3 AP over all classical\\nobject detection methods.\\nPresently, most Transformer Backbones are primarily active in im-\\nage classification, with only a few researchers transitioning them to tra-\\nditional object detectors for dense prediction. These have then achieved\\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared to CNN-based Back-\\nbones, Transformer-based Backbones can integrate global contextual\\ninformation while outputting multi-scale feature maps, thereby enhanc-\\ning feature extraction. Although Transformers have challenged CNN’s\\ndominance in object detection, recent advancements such as FAIR’s\\nredesign of ConvNet (Liu et al., 2022b), which draws from the strengths\\nof the Transformer structure, underscore the continued potential of\\nCNNs. In the future, CNN and visual Transformer are expected to\\ncontinue improving by leveraging each other’s strengths.\\n4.

This section will summarize the innovative improvements\\nof the current method, analyze the problems encountered by the\\nTransformer detector, and give an outlook on the future development\\nprospects.\\n4.1. Challenges\\nHigh computational overhead. Typical properties of CNNs include\\ninductive bias, which is expressed as translation invariance, weight\\nsharing, and sparse connectivity (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). These prop-\\nerties grant CNNs a robust local feature extraction capability and enable\\nthem to achieve high performance through the simple sliding match-\\ning of convolutional kernels. As a result, compared to Transformers,\\nCNNs often exhibit competitive performance with lower computational\\noverhead. However, current CNN architectures possess less potential\\nthan Transformers due to their weaker extraction of global features and\\ncontextual information. The self-attention mechanism in Transformers\\ncan also emulate convolutional layers, requiring only a sufficient num-\\nber of heads to focus on each pixel within the convolutional receptive\\nfield and employing relative positional encoding to ensure translation\\ninvariance (Cordonnier et al., 2020). This full-attention operation can\\neffectively integrate local and global attention while dynamically gen-\\nerating attention weights based on feature relationships. Nevertheless,\\nTransformers face certain limitations in practical applications. One of\\nthe main challenges stems from their high computational complexity.\\nThe expensive computational overhead restricts the application\\nof Transformer-based detectors on mobile computing platforms. At\\npresent, most mobile detection platforms primarily rely on one-stage\\ndetectors (Zhao et al., 2019), while the trend for Transformer de-\\ntectors leans towards offline high-precision detection. Additionally,\\nTransformers require large amounts of data, and common solutions\\ninclude data augmentation, self-supervised, or semi-supervised learning\\napproaches (He et al., 2021). Compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based\\napproaches, their deployment on mobile platforms is constrained by\\nhigher computational complexity.\\nThe impact of computational overhead on deploying Transformer-\\nbased object detection models in practical scenarios is influenced by\\nfactors such as the number of parameters, running time (FPS), and\\nfloating-point operations (FLOPs). However, these metrics’ influence\\nvaries depending on the application context and hardware environ-\\nment. For example, in situations like autonomous driving or robotic\\nnavigation, FPS is a critical factor, as algorithms must process video\\nstreams at high frame rates to respond quickly to external changes.\\nIn the case of mobile devices and embedded systems, the number of\\nparameters and FLOPs are more influential due to energy and memory\\nconstraints. Consequently, deploying algorithms on mobile platforms\\nnecessitates balancing performance, energy consumption, and memory\\nusage. In cloud computing and high-performance hardware settings,\\ncomputational overhead is not the most critical factor since compu-\\ntational resources are relatively abundant. In these scenarios, model\\nperformance and accuracy are paramount.\\nAccording to the data in Table 4, Table 5, modern Transformer-\\nbased models have outperformed classical two-stage object detection\\nalgorithms (e.g., Faster R-CNN) in terms of FPS and achieved improved\\naccuracy, rendering them viable for practical applications. To ensure\\nefficient deployment and application in real-world engineering sce-\\nnarios, researchers typically optimize object detection algorithms for\\nspecific contexts, minimizing computational overhead and improving\\nreal-time performance and energy efficiency. This optimization may\\ninvolve techniques such as model compression, knowledge distillation,\\nand network architecture design.\\nInsufficient understanding of visual Transformer. Compared to\\nthe well-established research and applications of CNNs, our current un-\\nderstanding of the underlying mechanisms behind visual Transformers\\nis still limited. The Transformer architecture was originally designed for\\nsequence processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017). Although Transform-\\ners have demonstrated strong performance when applied to computer\\nvision tasks, there is relatively little explanation regarding their specific\\nroles and functions in this context. Consequently, gaining a deeper\\nunderstanding of the principles behind visual Transformers is crucial\\nto facilitate more fundamental optimization improvements and en-\\nhance the model’s interpretability. This deeper understanding could\\npotentially involve investigating the attention mechanisms, hierarchical\\nfeature representation, and the interaction between different layers\\nEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107021\\n14\\nY.

By exploring these aspects, we\\ncan potentially uncover novel optimization strategies and improve the\\nmodel’s overall performance in various computer vision tasks.\\nThe inefficient image-sequence information transformation.\\nUnlike images, human-created languages have a high semantic density.\\nEach word in a sentence can be treated as high-dimensional semantic\\ninformation embedded in a low-dimensional vector representation.\\nHowever images, as a natural signal with high spatial redundancy,\\nhave a low information density per pixel. For example,\\nHe et al.\\n(2021) performed random high-scale masking of images, and then\\nreconstructed the images well with Decoder, demonstrating that much\\nhigher semantic features than pixel information density can be captured\\nin the images. But the current way of representing image information in\\nsequences using Transformer is not efficient enough, which can bring\\nabout accuracy degradation as well as high computational overhead.\\nEstablishing efficient transformations of image sequences can help\\nunlock the potential of the Transformer for CV tasks.\\n4.2. Future development outlook\\nVisual Transformer has made great progress in recent years, espe-\\ncially in object detection, and the performance has surpassed SOTA\\nCNN-based model on the COCO dataset. However, Transformer is not\\nmature enough in practical application deployment. For example, the\\ncomputational overhead is too large to be deployed on platforms with\\nlimited computer resources, and the real-time performance is not as\\ngood as the CNN-based one-stage approach.\\nSelf-supervised learning. While self-supervised learning has made\\na great success in natural language processing, current object detection\\nmodels, which are mainly supervised learning, require large amounts\\nEngineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 126 (2023) 107021\\n15\\nY. Li et al.\\nof high-quality manually labeled data, which is usually too expensive.\\nTherefore, It is natural to think of using self-supervised learning for\\nvisual tasks in order to pre-training models using a large amount of\\ncheap data available on the Internet. For example, the MAE proposed\\nby He et al. (2021) uses masked self-encoders for self-supervised learn-\\ning, which are adequately pre-trained and then migrated to specific\\ntasks for fine-tuning.\\nLightweight Transformer. Since the performance of the current\\nTransformer-based detector is powerful enough, the development of a\\nlightweight Transformer architecture should be considered to broaden\\nits applicability. Key considerations could include a reduction in com-\\nputational demands, optimization for object detection, and intelligent\\nquery design to ensure high performance while minimizing computa-\\ntional overhead. This would enable deployment on mobile platforms\\nwith limited computational resources.\\nMultitasking. Within CNN-based methods, Mask R-CNN (He et al.,\\n2017) successfully performs instance segmentation alongside object\\ndetection, yielding superior results. Could a Transformer detector also\\nundertake multiple tasks simultaneously and derive benefits from this\\napproach? For instance, the performance of the object detector could be\\nenhanced by incorporating semantic segmentation. Semantic segmenta-\\ntion captures object boundaries, aiding object localization in detection,\\nand segments the background to delineate the contextual information\\nof the object, improving detection probability. Such an approach is\\nespecially useful as objects typically exist within specific contexts, such\\nas cars appearing on roads.\\n5. Conclusion\\nFor the past decade, CNN-based models have reigned supreme in\\nthe field of object detection. However, the Transformer has recently\\ndemonstrated superior performance and substantial potential in com-\\nputer vision (CV), rendering Transformer-based models a burgeoning\\nresearch topic within object detection. In this paper, we have conducted\\nan extensive review of mainstream Transformer-based object detectors\\ndeveloped over the past three years. Our focus has mainly been on\\ntheir concepts, innovative aspects, and detection accuracy. We have\\ncategorized these methods according to their model structure and es-\\ntablished a benchmark based on the COCO2017 dataset. Furthermore,\\nwe have conducted a multi-perspective analysis and comparison of\\nthese methods, summarizing their innovations and enhancements. We\\nhave also provided a comprehensive analysis of their limitations and\\nsummarized the existing challenges that persist within the application\\nof Transformer in object detection. This study aims to aid readers in\\ndeepening their understanding of Transformer object detectors, spark-\\ning research interest to unleash the potential of the Transformer model,\\nand enhancing its practical applications.\\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\\nYong Li: Writing – review & editing, Supervision, Project admin-\\nistration.

This setup can handle complex queries, blending document search and language generation for more comprehensive answers."

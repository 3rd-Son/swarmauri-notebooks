    "# Design and Planning for RAG Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture of the RAG agent consists of several components:\n",
    "- **PDF Parser:** Converts PDF documents into text format.\n",
    "- **Chunker:** Breaks down the text into manageable pieces.\n",
    "- **Vector Store:** Stores the chunked documents for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "- **LLM Integration:** Uses GroqModel to generate responses based on retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Overview\n",
    "The RAG agent operates by first parsing a PDF document, converting it into text. This text is then chunked into smaller segments for better retrieval efficiency. The chunked documents are stored in a vector store, which allows for quick access based on user queries. The agent leverages GroqModel to understand the queries and generate accurate responses by retrieving relevant information from the stored chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Component Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### PDF Parser\n",
    "- **Functionality:** The PDF parser will utilize existing libraries (e.g., `FitzPdfParser`) to read and extract text from PDF files.\n",
    "- **Implementation:** The parser will handle different PDF structures, ensuring that all relevant content is captured, including text, tables, and figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunker\n",
    "- **Chunking Strategy:** The chunker will use a sentence-based approach to break the text into smaller segments, making it easier for the vector store to index and retrieve relevant pieces of information.\n",
    "- **Granularity:** Each chunk will typically consist of 1-3 sentences, balancing the need for context with retrieval efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Store\n",
    "- **Type of Vector Store:** The project will employ a TF-IDF vector store to index the chunked documents.\n",
    "- **Functionality:** The vector store will support efficient querying and retrieval of documents based on their relevance to user queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Logic\n",
    "- **Processing Queries:** The RAG agent will receive user queries, convert them into a format suitable for vector search, and retrieve relevant chunks from the vector store.\n",
    "- **Response Generation:** The agent will leverage GroqModel to generate coherent responses by combining the retrieved information with the context of the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. User Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### UI Design\n",
    "A simple user interface for interacting with the RAG agent could consist of:\n",
    "- **Text Input Field:** For users to enter their queries.\n",
    "- **Submit Button:** To send the query to the agent.\n",
    "- **Response Display Area:** To show the agent's generated response.\n",
    "- **Feedback Section:** Allowing users to provide feedback on the accuracy and relevance of the responses.\n",
    "\n",

    "An intelligent AI tool for detecting emotional tones in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "1. Clone this repository\n",
    "2. Create virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`\n",
    "3. Activate virtual environment\n",
    "4. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`\n",
    "5. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your API keys\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Tool Design Planning**\n",
    "### **What Will Our Tool Do?**\n",
    "1. Read and process text files (like understanding a conversation)\n",
    "2. Detect emotional tones (like reading between the lines)\n",
    "3. Create visualizations of sentiment (like drawing emotion maps)\n",
    "4. Answer questions about text emotions (like an empathetic friend)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Components We Need**\n",

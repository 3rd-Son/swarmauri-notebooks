    "# **Advanced Text Tools with Swarmauri**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "Text readability analysis is crucial for ensuring content is accessible to your target audience. The swarmauri library provides two powerful tools for this purpose:\n",
    "1. Flesch-Kincaid Tool: Measures reading ease and grade level\n",
    "2. Gunning-Fog Tool: Measures text complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools help writers and content creators optimize their text for specific reading levels and audience comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Practical Implementation**\n",

    "### **1. Flesch-Kincaid Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Flesch-Kincaid readability tool is a widely used metric for evaluating the readability of text. It provides a score that estimates the level of education required to understand a piece of writing. This information is valuable for a variety of applications, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Content writing and editing: Ensuring that your written content is accessible to your target audience.\n",
    "- Educational material development: Verifying that your educational resources are appropriate for the intended grade level.\n",
    "- User experience optimization: Improving the clarity and comprehension of your website or application content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The FleschKincaidTool is a readability analysis tool that calculates the Flesch-Kincaid readability score for a given text. This score is a widely used metric that estimates the level of education required to understand a piece of writing. The tool considers factors such as the average number of words per sentence and the average number of syllables per word to determine the readability level.\n",
    "The Flesch-Kincaid readability tool calculates a score based on two factors: the average number of words per sentence and the average number of syllables per word. \n",

    "The Swarmauri library provides the FleschKincaidTool, which encapsulates the Flesch-Kincaid readability calculation. \n",
    "You can use this tool by passing in a dictionary with a 'input_text' key, and it will return a dictionary with the calculated 'reading_ease' and 'grade_level' values.\n",
